# Resolve Tilde

Resolve Tilde is a quick and easy package to, well, resolve tildes. Tildes are the wavy symbols (`~`) that Dart can't naturally expand.

## Layout

This package includes some constants.

- `tilde`: This is defined in the top level, so if the package is imported, you can simply reference `tilde` to get `~` as a `String`.
- `Tilde.tilde`: This is the exact same thing as the above constant, except it's a static member of the `Tilde` class.
